With “Q-Day”, when quantum computers could crack standard encryption expected around 2033, teams are racing to protect digital systems. Quantum Shield Labs just launched Crypto Scanner, a free, open-source command-line tool. It scans codebases for weak cryptography that quantum attacks could break. The “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” Danger Attackers today grab
